# API Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned improvements and enhancements for the backend API. The improvements are categorized by priority and estimated effort.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins üöÄ

These improvements can be implemented quickly with minimal architectural changes.

### API Protection & Rate Limiting

- [ ] Implement request rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add request timeout handling
- [ ] Set appropriate request body size limits
- [ ] Add API versioning middleware with deprecation notices

**Expected Timeline**: 1-2 days  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk**: Low

## Phase 2: Core Improvements üîß

These improvements enhance the API's reliability, maintainability, and developer experience.

### Documentation

- [ ] Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] Set up automated API documentation generation
- [ ] Create API usage examples and guides

### Error Handling & Validation

- [ ] Implement schema validation middleware (Zod/Joi)
- [ ] Standardize error response formats
- [ ] Enhance validation error messages
- [ ] Add request payload validation

**Expected Timeline**: 1 week  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk**: Medium

## Phase 3: Performance & Monitoring üìà

These improvements focus on API performance, scalability, and observability.

### Caching & Performance

- [ ] Implement Redis caching strategy
- [ ] Add ETag support for resource caching
- [ ] Implement pagination for list endpoints
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes

### Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] Implement request tracing with correlation IDs
- [ ] Set up structured logging
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Create comprehensive health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards

**Expected Timeline**: 2 weeks  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk**: Medium

## Phase 4: Security Enhancements üîí

These improvements strengthen the API's security posture.

### Security Features

- [ ] Implement API key management
- [ ] Add request signing for sensitive operations
- [ ] Set up IP-based access control
- [ ] Implement refresh token rotation
- [ ] Add rate limiting by user/IP
- [ ] Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

**Expected Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk**: High

## Phase 5: Architectural Improvements üèóÔ∏è

These improvements focus on long-term maintainability and scalability.

### Architecture Refinements

- [ ] Implement service layer pattern
- [ ] Add repository pattern for database operations
- [ ] Split routes into domain-specific modules
- [ ] Implement event-driven patterns for async operations
- [ ] Add support for background jobs
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection

**Expected Timeline**: 3-4 weeks  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk**: High

## Notes

### Priority Levels

- **Critical**: Must be implemented for security/stability
- **High**: Significantly improves the API
- **Medium**: Enhances API quality
- **Low**: Nice to have

### Risk Levels

- **High**: Requires significant testing and careful implementation
- **Medium**: Moderate complexity with manageable risks
- **Low**: Straightforward implementation with minimal risks

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Each phase should include comprehensive testing
2. Documentation should be updated with each change
3. Changes should be backward compatible where possible
4. Security implications should be reviewed for each change
5. Performance impact should be measured for significant changes

## Future Considerations

- Microservices architecture (if needed)
- GraphQL API support
- Real-time capabilities (WebSocket/SSE)
- Multi-region deployment
- Advanced caching strategies
- AI/ML integration points
